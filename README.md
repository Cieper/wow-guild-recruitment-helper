# Guild Recruitment Helper

This very basic addon was developed to help with guild recruitment across different realms. It can announce your guild recruitment information to Trade and LFG channels. You can specify message, channels and announce interval.

Please respect server and the people playing on it. Set your announce interval and spam protection settings accordingly. Keep your message clean, simple and short.

Be careful, if you abuse server channels **BLIZZARD COULD SUSPEND/BAN YOUR ACCOUNT**. Use at your own risk.
